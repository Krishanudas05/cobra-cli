Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim, unedited copies of this license document.

Terms and Conditions:
=====================

1. Do whatever you want with the code, just don't:
	1(a). Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name
	1(b). Selling the unmodified original with no productive work done, including name-changes, one-liners and such.
	1(c). Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content, including viruses, keyloggers, and other harmful content. Harmful content can include sexual and/or violent content, or content with manipulative, dishonest, slanderous, unethical or other harmful material.
	1(d). Selling a project with educational purposes without consulting the original creator. 

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a beer or a pizza.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching is not right. Fix the problem yourself or submit a bug report, so that the original creator can attempt to fix the problem.

	3(a). BUG REPORTING ETIQUETTE:
		a.  First and foremost, understand that for the vast majority of people, this is a hobby, not a job. It may take some time for your issue to be resolved. Being a jerk or bossy is likely to get you banned or at the least have your issue dismissed.
		b.  Write in clear, concise manner what the issue is with steps to reproduce
    			Bad: My phone is broken, help!
    			Good: Whenever I open YouTube after a clean flash, it force closes.
		c.  Explain what you have done. A developer should not have to ask what has already been attempted.
		d.  Provide any scenarios where it did work (was it working in a previous update, etc.)
		e.  If you are technically inclined, provide commits that are either the issue or will resolve the issue. Developers love having a solution presented for them.
		f.  Refer to this document to know more how to: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html 

4. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

5. Source code. 

	The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

	A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

	The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

	The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

	The "Corresponding source" NEEDS TO INCLUDE MATERIAL USED TO GENERATE THE RESULTING BINARY/EXECUTABLE, AND NEEDS TO BE RELEASED UNDER THE SAME LICENSE. Without the material used to make the source code compilable, the "License" is considered violated. The source needs to be released with complete Git history including the sources for the "System Libraries" or at least the binaries of the "System Libraries".

	The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

6. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

	No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

	When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

7. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

	You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
